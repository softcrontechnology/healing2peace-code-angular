            <p>Sharing & learning from each other’s experiences is much needed to heal and grow personally/professionally. When you share the stories 
                of your victories and defeats, healing starts unfolding naturally and you come out as a new person who is more resilient, calm and wise. 
                By sharing your stories, you stay in touch with your true self and process your past in an effective way. It helps you along with your 
                listeners. You build a community of trust and vulnerability. It boosts your self-esteem and confidence. </p>
