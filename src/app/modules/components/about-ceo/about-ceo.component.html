                The violence and abuse in the home kept on increasing day by day till her daughter got hospitalized in critical condition due to the affects. 
                This made Ms. Anju to open about the abuse in front of the doctors. When her daughter was released from the hospital, she was moved to a safe place, 
                the Battered Women and Children’s Shelter. She calls it her re-birth as she was a resident there for 9 months.  </p>
                <p >Her life has been a struggle during and after the abuse. As a result of continuous abuse & trauma,

                    conditions and immigration status doesn’t allow her to start a new life, where she already has lost everything.</p>

                without any judgements. She realized that journaling and documenting her journey, not only helped her and her medical team, but others could
